## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time doing any frontend development since college. I reviewed basic CSS and HTML to get this projtect working.

Importing google fonts was easy once you use the import function they provide for you! Also flexbox was a challenge but overall a nice, challenging, first project!

### Continued development

Time for the next challenge!
